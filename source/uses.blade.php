                            Prior to this I was using a custom built AlphaSync Windows PC with an AMD Ryzen 9. This new machine is faster, quieter and does not heat up at all.
                            It also has the added benefit of mac OS development experience which I believe is second to none.

                            I have recently upgraded my headset after using my Google Pixel Buds for quite some time. I loved using my Pixel Buds, but the battery life often was not enough for an entire stream, even after a full charge. So I have recently upgraded to a gaming headset which has a 16 hour charge - which should be much better. It also features directional sound microphone so hopefully it mutes out some noise from the keyboard too.

                            I have recently upgraded to the keychron k2 after getting loads of advice on these keyboards. It is a little more compact than I am used to, but I will adjust soon enough. I am currently using the blue switches, which are the loadest that keychron have, but am testing them out before I move to a different set - I have been advised to use Red switches as they are quieter.

                            I can't say just how good fathom analytics is, because you wouldn't believe me. After years of frustration and privacy issues using Google Analytics I made the change to fathom and it has been delightful. I can easily set up and track goals, monitor site statistics, all without compromising my visitors privacy.
