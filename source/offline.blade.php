                </a> a property development finance company based in the UK, where I spend most of my time
                working on improving our platform aimed at property developers, and working on new features to find ways
                we can add extra value to our datasets.

                I also spend some time moonlighting as a consultant CTO, and freelance software engineer for various clients
                from around the world.
                As a consultant CTO I have been involved in some major Digital Transformation projects, API consulting, open

            <p>
                When I am not writing code, or advising someone, I spend a lot of my spare time with my family, cooking, and
                contributing to open source and the community.
