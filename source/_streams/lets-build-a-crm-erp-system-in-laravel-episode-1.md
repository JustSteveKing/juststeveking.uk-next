In this series join me as we build a custom CRM system in Laravel, that is part of a bigger ERP system. All code will be open sourced, and free to use.

In this session we will start building and planning our module system for Laravel - an easy way to add new modules to our ERP system. The first is a CRM module, which will allow us to track deals for clients and manage our contacts.
