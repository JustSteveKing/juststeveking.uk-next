Join me on a journey as I build a fictional start up from scratch, all live on stream. This will be split over several episodes, and the more time goes on the more complex parts of our application will get.

We continue our journey on building our start up, and this time we are taking a break from the technical aspects of event sourcing - and moving onto InertiaJS. We are going to start building out our applications UI, create the controllers that tie into our event sourcing model and start seeing things happen in the background.
