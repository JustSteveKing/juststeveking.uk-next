Join me as we start a new series building an Online Store with Laravel. We will be coving a topic at a time, making sure we deep dive into as much detail as we can do.

In this second episode we will pick up where we left off, and start focusing on our Product Catalog. How is stock managed, how do we have variations on products? We are going to focus here on interactions with products to see what events are going to be triggered, what actions need to be handled, and how this can reflect back to the user.
