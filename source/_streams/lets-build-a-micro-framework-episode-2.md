In our last stream we started building our micro-framework, we built a pretty solid foundation for us to start building ontop of - writing tests using pestPHP as we went.

In this stream we are going to start looking at how we can process routes and integrate a router into our framework. We will also cover writing commands for minicli, so that we can have a structured workflow for development.
