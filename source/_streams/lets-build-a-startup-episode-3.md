Join me on a journey as I build a fictional start up from scratch, all live on stream. This will be split over several episodes, and the more time goes on the more complex parts of our application will get.

Last episode we dived into some more technical aspects; covering DTOs and DTO factories, event sourcing using aggregates projectors and reactors. Let's carry on with our journey as we go back over these parts again in detail as we start to pull in podcast episodes from our podcast feed. This time we will be using the PHPUgly podcast as an example.
