Join me as we start a new series building an Online Store with Laravel. We will be covering a topic at a time, making sure we deep dive into as much detail as we can do.

For my subscribers, if you use the code ["I-know-Steve-on-Youtube"](https://conference.scotlandphp.co.uk/2021/tickets?discount=I-know-Steve-on-Youtube) you can get 10% off the ticket cost for the upcoming scotlandPHP conference! 

In this fourth episode we will pick up where we left off, and start an event storming session where we will go through the process of adding products to our cart, and turning a cart into an order. From here we can design out events we want to store, plan any side effects - and test the process in advance of building it.
