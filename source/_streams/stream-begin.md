My first live stream where I am testing the experience and polishing how I can present. The quality isn't fantastic, as I needed to test lighting sound and camera to make sure future streams go smoothly.


Join me as I refactor parts of PHPOnline, and add a new feature for crawling podcasts from a feed URL.
