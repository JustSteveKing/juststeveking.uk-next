In this stream I am going back to basics, Laravel basics.

Join me on a journey as I build a fictional start up from scratch, all live on stream. This will be split over several episodes, and the more time goes on the more complex parts of our application will get.

Last time we focused mostly on routes and views, some Blade components, nothing too technical. We started building out some Eloquent Models, and were just about to start working on creating Podcasts. This time we are going to pick up where we left off, and start working the server side interactions for creating podcasts, what happens when we create a podcast - are there any changes we need to make to out Models and migrations?
