In this stream we are going to work through a process of how I like to work with 3rd party APIs.

We will first look at how we can integrate with an API that only accepts GET requests, a 3rd party data service. Then we will look at an API that is more of a deeper integration - and see what the differences in how we integrate with it are.

This stream is a video representation of the article I wrote on the topic, but also an extention as something do not translate to words as well as they do code:
