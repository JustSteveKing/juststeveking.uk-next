In this stream we will be refactoring my PHP SDK framework so that we can focus on the developer experience, and upgrade the underlying dependencies which have been updated.

This will be a breaking change release, as we will be dropping the minimum requirement to PHP 8.0, and changing the API so that we can really focus on making building SDKs an easy and delightful experience.
