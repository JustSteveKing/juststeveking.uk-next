In this stream we are going to look at Slim v4 and build a project skeleton so we can quickly bootstrap Slim PHP projects quickly.

We will be covering things like setting up a CLI to make the development experience easier, adding in database Migrations, setting up our DI Container.

By the end of this stream we should have a boilerplate almost ready to start building lightweight APIs using Slim PHP.
