In this new series I am going to start building a start up idea I have had, and I want to build this in the open to allow others to learn from the experience.

There will be work dont behind the scenes still, as this is intended to be a viable SaaS product for my business - but I will stream as much of this build as I can.

Join me and let's discuss the challenges and fun things we get to do when building a new tech start up.
