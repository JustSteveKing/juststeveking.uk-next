In this stream we get super early access to the [usefathom.com](https://usefathom.com/ref/IB4OTH) API with special thanks to Jack Ellis!

Join me as we build out a CLI application to get website statistics from the API very quickly. We will be using Laravel Zero to build a really cool little CLI application, and PestPHP to test out API.
