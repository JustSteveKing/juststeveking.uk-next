Join me as we start a new series building an Online Store with Laravel. We will be coving a topic at a time, making sure we deep dive into as much detail as we can do.

In this first episode we will do project set up, data modelling, application structure, and start looking at how our application works on a higher level. This will include looking at how we deal with our Customers/Users.
